                        <p>  This webpage is designed to showcase my work during my time learning in CSC106! 
        This is my first Webpage for this course too :)! I am excited to begin working through the process of coding and I am ready to learn. I am looking foward to gaining an understanding of JavaScript as well as other computer languages so I can code various things and showcase them!
