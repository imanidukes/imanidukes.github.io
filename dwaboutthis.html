                         I'm Imani and I'm 18 turning 19 in November! I plan to become a video game designer as well as a storyline director in the video game development field of CS. I consider myself a gamer due to the fact that I've been gaming for God knows how long. I enjoy spending my time relaxing and gathering my thoughts as well as hanging out with my friends. Balancing out these activities helps me relax overall.
