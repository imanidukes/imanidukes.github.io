                       <center> <p>  <strong> This webpage is designed to showcase my work during my time learning in CSC106! 
        This is my first Webpage for this course too :)! I am excited to begin working through the process of coding and I am ready to learn. I am looking foward to gaining an understanding of JavaScript as well as other computer languages so I can code various things and showcase them! This is so exciting :D</strong>
